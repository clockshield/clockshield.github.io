<h2>COVID-19 Face Shield Donations.</h2>
<p>
This robotics team named Dry Ice 9784 is 3d printing Covid-19 masks. They are a team of six that are dedicated to helping people at all costs. They stay up until morning just to make enough masks for one-thousand people. They have already dropped it off at the hospitals near San Francisco Bay Area, and they have shipped it to a hospital in Texas. This process was not easy to do though. They first had to get the money for the materials. Then they had to build the printers which was quite complex. Once they built it they needed to create a file to make it.  They needed to buy a plastic named P L A. They used up all the plastic up so fast that they needed to buy more at one time. Although this sounds easy, it was a burdensome experience. I wish I can help but I am too young. I hope I used my voice to make a difference here. If you want to help these significant people, please donate at http://www.gofundme.com/f/dryice Thank you.

<h2>Is It Really Jimmy Garopolo‚Äôs Fault For Losing the Super Bowl?</h2>
  <p>No It isn‚Äôt. Even though Jimmy didn‚Äôt do nearly as well as he did in the regular season. I still do not blame him. There is another man I blamed for the loss of the super bowl. Kyle Shannahan is the one to blame. In the fourth quarter, it was 3rd and 15 Chiefs ball. They are down 10. Out of nowhere, the chiefs pass the football to the touchdown zone! Then they got a touchdown. Kyle should have told his team to get ready for it in case it happens. Its the super bowl! You have to take risks.  He should have told his defensive line up to do a cover zone. Then the chiefs would only be able to get it a few yards and not get first. Now it‚Äôs 17 ‚Äì 20. The chiefs are still in this. It‚Äôs 2nd and 5th. Instead of running the ball, coach Kyle has a different plan to pass it. Why would he do that though? Why not just run it and get first down again. They pass it for 2 plays! They had to punt the ball at 4th down. That was the play that lost them the game. Their defense couldn‚Äôt do anything to stop the chief‚Äôs offense. Once they got the ball they turned the ball over again! How can you do that in a Superbowl game? Once That happened the chiefs got another touchdown and it was game over.

  <h2> Why Lebron James is not a Goat</h2>
  <p>Lebron James should have not left the Cavs. He doesn‚Äôt even play defense and blames it on his teammates. He calls himself a goat when his team is 11th in the western conference and is doing horrible. Out of nowhere he says he will go to ‚ÄúPlayoff Mode‚Äù Watch that video right now. RIGHT NOW!! You watched it right. Good cause now you know what I mean by doesn‚Äôt even play defense. I do not think the Lakers will go to the playoffs. At least in the Cavs He had Kevin and Kyrie to pass too. He also played more defense. Lebron only cares about his stats. He Tries to shoot every possession and just lets the other team score. Does that make sense. I mean he still is good at offense but at defense he is a James Harden. I‚Äôm not even joking. Harden plays defense at least a little though. Lebron is not even trying. It‚Äôs like your better than someone and you act like your cocky but then out of nowhere you get destroyed by the team you thought was bad. Yeah that‚Äôs what Lebron is doing right now. Being cocky and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think Lebron James is a goat.</p>

  <h2>The Story of Jeremy Lin</h2>
  <p>Jeremy Lin never got a scholarship to any school. When he was in Harvard Jeremy was carrying their team to victory. He even dominated John Wall but still didn‚Äôt get a scholarship. No team decided to draft Jeremy but he still worked hard. The Warriors finally signed him for summer league but he got to play garbage time. He went on to the rockets then to the knicks. The knicks were losing so much that Mike d‚Äôantoni finally let him play that night which he dominated the game. They had a humongous comeback and Lin got a career high. Althought it might seem it was the best time Carmelo Anthony was jealous. Lin was then  traded to the rockets then Lakers and Charlotte then to Nets then to Atlanta Lin is now playing with Trae Young and averaging about 10 points per game and 3 assists with 50% field goal percentages. He might now finally go back and be himself again. He might Still be Linsanity like he was before. Maybe he will finally dominate the NBA and be MVP. I hope he will be still be Linsanity and beat the Warriors. Even though he got injured he is still working  massively hard to be Linsanity.</p>

  <h2>KD and Green</h2>
  <p>I did do this about the clippers against rockets but this time its clippers vs warriors.If you watched the game Warriors against Clippers on 11-12-18 you will know what happened. At the 4th quarter on the last possession, KD wanted the ball but Draymond didn‚Äôt pass it. KD was furious at the bench and they were getting heated. In the locker room, it was so bad that Draymond Green was suspended the next game. KD and Draymond Green had the biggest fight ever. Just like when the Rockets vs Clippers the same thing happen but instead of teammates it was old partners.  After the game he was suspended he got injured the next game. If Curry wasn‚Äôt injured none of this chaos wouldn‚Äôt of happen because they would already have the lead. KD also said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm done with the warriors‚Äù. What could that possibly mean?  If KD does leave the Warriors then Green gets kicked out too I‚Äôm presume because why in the world would you want a player on you team that kicks your privates in the game. What team could KD want to play for though? Will he go back to OKC and be Warriors rival or will he stay and have a bad relationship with Draymond Green. Honestly If I was KD I would ask the GM to kick Draymond Green out of the team. On the other hand, If I was the GM of the warriors then I would trade Draymond because he kicks people‚Äôs nuts. Proof that he kicks peoples privates:

  <h2>The Free Throw Line</h2>
  <p>I was warming up. We were playing against the Road Runners. My team‚Äôs record was 1-1. We lost against the Voyagers but won against the Warrior. Their record was 0-2. I was warming up my Free Throws at the line. 1-2-3. 3 Slow dribbles then the shot. After 5 mins the game was starting. My team only had 8 people and I started as Point Gaurd. When the ball jumped in the air like a kangaroo our Center jumped as a bunny and got the tip. I got the ball slowly I dribbled and held up a 4 which means a screen for our team and I got the pick successfully and got an easy 3. My team pressed a 2-2-1. When the player from the Road Runners inbounded it to the Point Guard our team‚Äôs shooting guard quickly snatched the ball and rested the ball to me. I quickly drove past my man and past the ball to our center for a layup. 5-0. I was subbed out quickly because my coach wants the bench players to play more. When the score becomes close he subs me in. My coach starts me so that our team could get the lead. At halftime the score was close so my coach sub me in. The Road Runners had a really good player but he just never plays any of the games because he always never come. But this game he came. We started with the ball and I called a double screen. This time I didn‚Äôt get the pick. I got the roll. I whipped it over to my PF and he layed it in. I guarded the PG but he wasn‚Äôt the best player in the team. The SG was. The Road Runners Passed it to the SG and he crossed up the SG on our team and got a floater. I quickly got the ball and dribbled it up the ball and I got a very hard shooting foul. I got subbed out right after I shot my free throws. I made 1-2. I came back in right when there were 24 secs left. It was a tie game 32-32. I dribbled the ball slowly and wasted some time right when there were 5 secs left I drove in and got a shooting foul there was 0.1 secs left on the clock.1-2-3. I shot my free throw and swished it. 1-2-3 I shot my other free throw and swished that too. They got the rebound and it was game over.

  <h2>Why Ben Simmons is a Rookie Legend</h2>
  <p>Ben Simmons a rookie legend clearly for an expert at basketball. He can score, he can pass, he can do anything he wants on the court. He averages about 15 points a game and 8 assists. Because of him, the Sixers are going to the playoffs. But there is another player named Joel Embiid who carries the team. They both could carry the team to the playoffs. With Joel shooting 3‚Äôs and Ben dishing it to open players and driving to the hoop they could be unstoppable. He‚Äôs like a curry but without shooting 3‚Äôs. I think he is the best passer there is with the assist and layups. When the Sixers VS Hornets Ben blocked Kemba Walker to save the game and win. Today the Sixers vs Miami. Right now the Sixers are 3rd in the conference! To Boston in the season 2017-2018, they only lost by 2 in the last game. It was very thrilling for that last game.</p>

  <h2>Lonzo vs Curry</h2>
  <p>Hi my name is blah blah blah and today I am going to do a Stehphen Curry against Lonzo ball stats.

So first lets talk about Lonzo Ball. he‚Äôs a 6 foot 6 he can pass I get it but on his first summer league game against the clipper he got ANKLE BROKEN.  Ok lets be serious on your first summer league game you get ankle broken. Thats just wrong Lonzo. Now lets talk about the ‚ÄúReal season‚Äù. Lonzo shoots a 30% 3 pointer and misses open 3‚Äôs. Oh yeah I forgot you see that video up top yeah he misses open layups too. Now lets talk about curry lets see his stats. Curry has at least 42%. Not bad against a person that has a 30% 3 percentage. He also shoots alot of clutch shots. When I mean alot I mean alot.

  <p>If you watch this video you will see him like a sniper from long range. He can get as much points as he wants when he actually wants it. He can also break players ankles basically when he really wants it. He is a master a ball handling too. That is how he is the ankle break master too. Curry is the winner.

  <h2>An Unsuspecting Loss</h2>
  <p>Monday night, it was the Clippers against Rockets with Chris Paul in the Rockets. No James Harden on the Rockets and no Austin Rivers and Deandre Jordan for the Clippers. It was also the home of the Clippers. Blake Griffin got 29 points, 6 assists and 10 rebounds. It was also a drama night Blake got 1 tech and had alot of fights with Chris Paul / CP3. When it was the 4th qaurter 3:34 seconds left a fight was going on against Paul and Blake. Lou Williams got 31 points, 9 assists and 3 rebounds plus 40 mins on the court. austin rivers had a conversation with Treavor Ariza on the bench then when Blake came both of them got sent back to their lockers. Treavor wanted to go to the clippers lockers but the players on the clippers pushed him and stuff. At the end it was 102-113 the clippers had won. Clint Capela got requested to knock on the clippers locker room to see what they were doing. I never saw this or heard about this drama. Lucky I wasn‚Äôt one of those players in those two teams. It was a horrible night and it was even Martin Luther king Jr‚Äôs birthday. It looked like it wasn‚Äôt even basketball any more. It looked like a movie. Houston was up basically the whole game. I don‚Äôt know how they got back up and won. I can‚Äôt lie thought the clippers got alot better. They are 7th in the conference. I think the will make it to the conference finals against probably the warriors.</p>
<h2>The Big Comeback</h2>
  <p>12/2/17

    ‚ÄúCurry is on fire!‚Äù I proclaimed. When the Warriors vs the Pelicans on Thanksgiving weekend November 25, 2017, the Warriors were losing in the first half. Curry was cold at the first quarter. But he did end up 27 points. The first quarter it was 17-31 Warriors were losing badly but in the 2nd quarter they got 36 points but pelicans got 22 so at the end of the first half they tied it up 53-53. At the end of the game Curry got 27 points with 6 assist and Davis got 30 points with 15 rebounds and Thomspson got 24 points with 4 rebounds. In half time there was a team called Bay City. I was in that team in AAU. They played a scrimmage. The second half is where Curry is like Kyle Korver but Basically making all his 3‚Äôs. He lighted 17 points in the third quarter. I know right. He‚Äôs like dude perfect that can make every full court shot. Now lets talk about Thompson the three point shooter. He made 24 points 2 steals and 2 blocks. Klay can make anything when he wants to basically and Curry too. Green got 6 points and 2 steals and 1 block. Dreymond can at least make a few points when he‚Äôs a lock down defender. He also got defense stuff too. I was also exhilarated because I high fived the players in the Pelicans and I shot a free throw at the end on the Warriors court. I missed my free throw but thought it was the best Nba moment of my life high-fiving the players in the fan tunnel pre-game and shooting free throws is something I will not forget.</p>
<h2>Who is Russell Westbrook</h2>
  <p>Russel Westbrook a NBA star featuring leadership, ball hogging, scoring and defending. Russell Westbrook won the NBA MVP award in the year 2016-2017. A All Star champion. He is a ball hog but a good one. He averages right now 21.6 points. I don‚Äôt know why his team is on a drought. They won 9 games and lost 11</p>
<h2>Warriors Crushed</h2>
<img src = "images/zazawarriorcrush.jpg">
  <p>11/22/17

‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm on the court I have no friends except for the ball‚Äù said Westbrook. The night Warriors vs the OKC was the night the Warriors got dumped. Curry the superstar got 6 turnovers with 24 points. Klay got 1 turnover but with only 9 points. Durant got booed basically every time he touched the ball. On the other side Westbrook got 34 points a season high. At the end of the game OKC got 108 points and Warriors got 91 points. At the third quarter Westbrook and Durant got into a fight with double techs. It was a horrible night for the Warriors. If your a Warriors fan and you hate the OKC because of the OKC crushed the Warriors don‚Äôt worry, the OKC basically lost all their games. Warriors are going to improve. They can‚Äôt be that bad I mean they have 4 stars in their team so their probably going to make it to the finals. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony on the other side both added together 44 points. Carmelo got 22 points and George got 20. George and Carmelo are probably going to be in the all star game but Westbrook will for sure be in it. The next game for the Warriors are going to be the bulls and a highly chance the Warriors are going to win.</p>
