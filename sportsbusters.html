<p>Hello this is the writing from my brother's blog page.</p>

<p>
This robotics team named Dry Ice 9784 is 3d printing Covid-19 masks. They are a team of six that are dedicated to helping people at all costs. They stay up until morning just to make enough masks for one-thousand people. They have already dropped it off at the hospitals near San Francisco Bay Area, and they have shipped it to a hospital in Texas. This process was not easy to do though. They first had to get the money for the materials. Then they had to build the printers which was quite complex. Once they built it they needed to create a file to make it.  They needed to buy a plastic named P L A. They used up all the plastic up so fast that they needed to buy more at one time. Although this sounds easy, it was a burdensome experience. I wish I can help but I am too young. I hope I used my voice to make a difference here. If you want to help these significant people, please donate at http://www.gofundme.com/f/dryice Thank you.
